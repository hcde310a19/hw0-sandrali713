# Description of your program (part 7)
To count all the words in a document, I would keep a variable called counter which starts at zero,
and parse through the text on the document by looking for spaces. Assuming each word is separated
by one space, and words with dashes are considered as one word, I think this would work pretty well.
# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
I wouldn't say the exercise was hard, but maybe a little confusing since I've never written a program
in English before and I'm not sure what the expectation is. It's hard since it seems more natural to
write in code (which I can't believe I'm saying), but it helps me see how coding can be more articulate
that a non-coding language. I don't know exactly what I want to get out of this class, I already am
semi-interested in Python and I think it's very useful, although coding is pretty hard for me in general.
I'd love the chance to work on a bigger project that I could continue after this course as well.
